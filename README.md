# 🚀 DyslexiCore: Early Literacy & Diagnostic Ecosystem

**DyslexiCore** is a full-stack literacy engine designed to identify and bridge reading gaps in neurodivergent children. By transforming clinical dyslexia screening into a "Space Mission," we remove the anxiety of assessment and provide parents with immediate, data-driven insights.

---

## 🌟 The Vision
Traditional dyslexia screening is expensive and slow. **DyslexiCore** shifts the paradigm from "Wait to Fail" to **"Play to Succeed."** Our platform captures micro-interactions—like naming speed and visual tracking—to build a comprehensive risk profile in minutes, not months.

## 🕹️ Core Features

### **1. Gamified Diagnostics**
* **⭐ Star Tracker:** A high-speed mission designed to measure **visual saccades** and tracking focus.
* **🫧 Phoneme Popper:** An interactive bubble-popping game that assesses **phonological decoding** and naming speed.

### **2. Intervention Quests**
* **🔡 CVC Word Explorer:** Focused modules (starting with **Short 'A'**) to master Consonant-Vowel-Consonant patterns.
* **⌨️ Typing Quest:** A multi-sensory tool that connects tactile typing with phonetic sounds.

### **3. Mission Control (Dashboard)**
* Real-time analytics hub powered by a persistent database.
* Calculates **Risk Levels (Low, Moderate, High)** based on game performance.

### **4. Smart Companion**
* An **AI-powered tutor** providing phonics-based hints and constant positive reinforcement.
