**🚀 DyslexiCore: Early Literacy \& Diagnostic Ecosystem**
DyslexiCore is a full-stack literacy engine designed to identify and bridge reading gaps in neurodivergent children. By transforming clinical dyslexia screening into a "Space Mission," we remove the anxiety of assessment and provide parents with immediate, data-driven insights.

**🌟 The Vision**
Traditional dyslexia screening is expensive and slow. DyslexiCore shifts the paradigm from "Wait to Fail" to "Play to Succeed." Our platform captures micro-interactions—like naming speed and visual tracking—to build a comprehensive risk profile in minutes, not months.

###### **🕹️ Features**

1. Gamified Diagnostics
   Star Tracker: A mission designed to measure visual saccades and tracking focus.

Phoneme Popper: An interactive bubble-popping game that assesses phonological decoding and naming speed.

2. Intervention Quests
   CVC Word Explorer: Focused modules (starting with Short 'A') to master Consonant-Vowel-Consonant patterns.

Typing Quest: A multi-sensory reinforcement tool that connects tactile typing with phonetic sounds.

3. Mission Control (Dashboard)
   A real-time analytics hub powered by a persistent database.

Calculates Risk Levels (Low, Moderate, High) based on game performance.

4. Smart Companion
   An AI-powered tutor that provides phonics-based hints and positive reinforcement, ensuring students never feel discouraged.
